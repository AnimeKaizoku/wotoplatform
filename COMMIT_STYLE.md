# Commit style for wotoplatform

- Commit messages should have enough explanation in them.
- Explanation should be word-wrapped at 72 characters, that means each line should not be more than 72 characters. (Except for quoted email, sign-off, link, compiler error message or anything that has certain specific format.)
- Signed-off-by tag should contain a name with proper capitalization of course.
- For more style preference, you can check [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html).
- For pull request style preference, you can take a look at [here](https://github.com/axboe/liburing/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md)
